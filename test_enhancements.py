The input layer receives data, hidden layers process it through weighted connections and activation functions, and the output layer produces results. 
                
                Training involves forward propagation where data flows through the network, and backpropagation where errors are used to adjust weights. Neural networks can learn complex non-linear relationships in data. Common architectures include feedforward networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data.
                
                Modern neural networks can have millions or billions of parameters, requiring specialized hardware like GPUs for training. Regularization techniques like dropout and batch normalization help prevent overfitting. Neural networks have applications in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, recommendation systems, and many other domains."""

                Self-attention computes relationships between all positions in a sequence simultaneously. Multi-head attention uses multiple attention mechanisms in parallel, capturing different types of relationships. Positional encoding adds information about token positions since attention is order-agnostic.
                
                The transformer architecture relies entirely on attention, eliminating recurrence and convolution. This enables parallel processing and better handling of long-range dependencies. Attention weights provide interpretability, showing which parts of the input the model considers important for each prediction. Attention has been crucial for the success of large language models like BERT and GPT."""
